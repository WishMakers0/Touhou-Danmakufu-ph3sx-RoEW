# Touhou Danmakufu ph3sx-RoEW

A fork of **Touhou Danmakufu ph3sx-zlabel**, which is in turn a fork of **Touhou Danmakufu ph3sx**, which is in turn a fork of **Touhou Danmakufu ph3**.

Made exclusively for use with Return of Eastern Wonderland, and open source in case a feature I implement is wanted in the main branch.
Otherwise, don't expect to be able to use this for your own scripts.  I won't say "for internal use only", but I won't help you should you try to use it.

For credits, please refer to the original ph3sx repository, as well as Naudiz' zlabel repository.
